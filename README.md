### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Vimeography was born out of a desire to create a good-looking gallery layout from a collection of Vimeo videos without all of the fuss. This WordPress plugin makes it dead-simple to create a video gallery that just works&trade;

More information can be found at [vimeography.com](http://vimeography.com/).

## Installation

For detailed setup instructions, visit the official [Documentation](http://vimeography.com/help/guide) page.

1. You can clone the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/davekiss/vimeography.git`
2. Or download it directly as a ZIP file: `https://github.com/davekiss/vimeography/archive/master.zip`

This will download the latest developer copy of Vimeography.

Then, be sure to define a constant called `VIMEOGRAPHY_DEV` in your `wp-config.php` file. This will ensure that the code bundle of your Vimeography themes will be loaded from the Webpack dev server rather than the theme's `dist` folder.

`define('VIMEOGRAPHY_DEV', true);`

Lastly, you can install the theme dependencies and start up the webpack dev server like so:

```
cd wp-content/plugins/vimeography/vimeography-harvestone
yarn install

# After a few minutes, the install will complete and you can start the server.
yarn start
```

## Releasing to WordPress.org
Vimeography uses tagged releases and GitHub actions to trigger deploys to WordPress.org

1. Make sure you've updated the Stable Tag in `readme.txt` and added revision notes to the changelog at the bottom of that file.
2. Make sure to update `vimeography.php` with the new version number on 

```php
// line ~6
Version: 2.3.1

// later, on line ~128
define('VIMEOGRAPHY_VERSION', '2.3.1');
```

3. Visit https://github.com/davekiss/vimeography/releases/new to create a new tag. Then, add any release notes pertaining to this version. When you're ready, click publish.

By following this process, you'll fire off a new GitHub action workflow which will build the plugin and upload it to WordPress.org via Subversion. Nice!

## Tests

1. Install PHPUnit
2. Install WP tests and database: `sh bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost latest`
3. `cd vimeography && phpunit`
