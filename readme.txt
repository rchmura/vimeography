== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I show hidden Vimeo videos? =

If you would like to show videos that are hidden from Vimeo, you will need [Vimeography Pro.](https://vimeography.com/add-ons/vimeography-pro/?utm_source=wpdotorg&utm_medium=faq)

The way that it works is you mark your videos as hidden from Vimeo and then place them in a Public showcase. You then use that showcase URL as the source for your video gallery. The videos won't appear anywhere on Vimeo, but will still be accessible by the Vimeography WordPress plugin.

= Help! My video gallery doesn't look right! =

First of all, don't worry! I promise you that we can get it looking right. This can be caused by a multitude of things, so try the following (in the order of appearance):

* Check your browser's javascript console to see if there are any errors that may be causing this issue.
* Try surrounding your Vimeography shortcode in `[raw][/raw]` tags.
* Make sure that your WordPress theme is not including multiple versions of jQuery and is using the latest version.
* Make sure that your theme is calling the `wp_footer()` function so that all of the Vimeography stylesheets are printed.
* Try disabling other plugins that are used for photo galleries, minifying scripts, widgets, or otherwise alter your site's appearance, one by one, and really determining if you need it.

= I'm getting an error: This Vimeography gallery does not have a theme assigned to it. =

Make sure that you have the latest version of the Vimeography theme plugin that you are using installed and that it is activated. Then, go to the gallery editor and select that theme under the Appearance tab. If you're still having problems, reach out on the Vimeography contact page.

= I'm having trouble installing a video gallery theme. =

Vimeography themes are treated as WordPress plugins. Make sure you're installing the Vimeography theme on the "Plugins" page in your WordPress dashboard.

= How do I get the latest updates for my video gallery themes? =

If you purchased your video gallery theme at vimeography.com, you should have received an email receipt containing an license key for your theme. Enter that license code on the "Manage Licenses" page of the Vimeography plugin. Once done, you will be subscribed to theme updates which will automatically be delivered to your WordPress installation, just like any other plugin.

= How do I add my Vimeography video gallery to a post or page? =

Easy! All you have to do is type `[vimeography id="#"]`, where `#` is replaced by the ID number of your Vimeo video gallery.

= Where do I find the ID number of my Vimeography video gallery? =

Each video gallery’s ID number is located next to the video gallery’s title in the first column on the edit galleries page.

= Can I override my Vimeography gallery settings in the shortcode? =

Sure thing! You can define all of the properties found in the admin panel right in your shortcode as well. Try using one, any, or all of the following parameters:
`[vimeography id="3" theme="thumbs" featured="http://vimeo.com/28380190" source="http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks" limit="60" cache="3600" width="600px"]`

= Can I add the Vimeography video gallery to my theme’s sidebar/footer/header etc.? =

Yes, but you’ll need some PHP knowledge to do it! Open the file you want to add the video gallery to, and type `<?php do_shortcode('[vimeography id="#"]'); ?>`, where `#` is replaced by the ID number of your gallery.

= Can I change the look of my Vimeography theme? =

Heck yeah! Use the appearance editor to change your video gallery theme's style so that it matches your site perfectly.

= Can I override my Vimeography theme template with some custom code? =

Sure, why not. Here's an example:

`
<?php

  function my_custom_harvestone_thumbnail() {
    ob_start();
  ?>
    <script type="text/x-template" id="vimeography-harvestone-thumbnail">
      <figure class="swiper-slide vimeography-thumbnail">
        <router-link class="vimeography-link" :to="this.query" exact exact-active-class="vimeography-link-active">
          <img class="vimeography-thumbnail-img" :src="thumbnailUrl" :title="video.name" />
        </router-link>
      </figure>
    </script>
  <?php
    echo ob_get_clean();
  }

  add_action('admin_head', 'my_custom_harvestone_thumbnail');
  add_action('wp_head', 'my_custom_harvestone_thumbnail');
`

Vimeography will load your template for the defined module instead of the default one for your theme.
