          <h2>Help! My theme doesn't look right!</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>First of all, don't worry! I promise you that we can get it looking right. This can be caused by a multitude of things, so try the following (in the order of appearance):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try surrounding your Vimeography shortcode in <code>[r<em></em>aw][/r<em></em>aw]</code> tags.</li>
              <li>Make sure that your WordPress theme is not including multiple versions of jQuery and is using the latest version.</li>
              <li>Make sure that your theme is calling the <code>wp_fo<em></em>oter();</code> function so that all of the Vimeography stylesheets are printed.</li>
              <li>Try disabling other plugins that are used for photo galleries, minifying scripts, widgets, or otherwise alter your blog's appearance, one by one, and really determining if you need it.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>How do I show my video's title/description in the gallery?</h2>
          <div class="answer">

You may be interested in checking out <a href="http://vimeography.com/themes" title="See all Vimeography themes">our other themes available for your galleries</a> - they will allow you to show other info associated with the videos on Vimeo.</p>

          <h2>Can I override my Vimeography theme template with some custom code?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Sure, why not. Simply copy your theme's <code>.mustache</code> file(s) into a new folder located at <code>wp-content/themes/[my_wordpress_theme]/vimeography/[my_vimeography_theme]</code> or <code>wp-content/themes/[my_wordpress_theme]/vimeography/[my_vimeography_theme]/partials</code> and hack away. Vimeography will load that template instead of the default one for your theme.</p>

          <h2>How do I add my gallery to a post or page?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Easy! All you have to do is type <code>[vimeography id="<span style="color:blue;">#</span>"]</code>, where <span style="color:blue;">#</span> is replaced by the ID number of your gallery.</p>
          </div>

        <article>
          <h2>Where do I find the ID number of my gallery?</h2>

          <h2>Can I override my gallery settings in the shortcode?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Sure thing! You can define all of the properties found in the admin panel right in your shortcode as well. Try using one, any, or all of the following parameters:</p>
            <code>[vimeo<em></em>graphy id="3" theme="journey" featured="http://vimeo.com/28380190" source="http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks" coupon="PUNCTILIOUS" cache="3600" width="600px"]</code>

          <div class="answer">
            <p>Yes, but you'll need some PHP knowledge to do it! Open the file you want to add the gallery to, and type <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[vimeography id="<span style="color:blue;">#</span>"]</strong>'); ?&gt;</code>, where <span style="color:blue;">#</span> is replaced by the ID number of your gallery.</p>

          <h2>I have Vimeography Pro, but I can still only show 25 videos. What gives?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>To show all of your videos in your gallery, make sure the <strong>"Number of Videos"</strong> setting in the Gallery editor is set to <strong>0</strong> - that will bypass all limits and get every video in your Vimeo collection.</p>

          <h2>Can I change the colors/layout of my theme?</h2>

          <h2>I'm getting an error: the plugin did not retrieve data from the Vimeo API! connect() timed out! </h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>This usually means that Vimeo is having some network issues. Check out the <a href="http://www.vimeostatus.com/" title="Vimeo Status Page">Vimeo Status Page</a> for updates.</p>
            <p>If Vimeo is not reporting any issues, you'll need to contact your host and ask why you are unable to connect to Vimeo's IP address. It may be that your host has blocked server access via a firewall.</p>
